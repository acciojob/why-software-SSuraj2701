	<h1>Why i want to become a developer?</h1>
	<!-- the entire body must be written by student -->
	<P>I enjoy solving problems and building things from scratch. Development allows me to turn ideas into real, functional applications, and that creative process is something I find deeply fulfilling.
	I've always been fascinated by technology and how software powers everything around us. Becoming a developer lets me be part of that world and contribute to building smarter, more efficient solutions</P>
